# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**CRITICAL USER REQUIREMENT**: Absolutely NO design, layout, or visual changes allowed. User has explicitly stated they don't want any modifications to the website's appearance, styling, or visual elements. Only backend performance optimizations that don't affect the user interface are acceptable.

**DESIGN REQUIREMENT**: The original website design uses a dark theme with dark background and white/light text. The website must always display in dark mode to match the original appearance exactly.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React 18 with TypeScript, implementing a modern component-based architecture:

- **Routing**: Uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing across different PDF tools
- **State Management**: Leverages React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Framework**: Built with shadcn/ui components based on Radix UI primitives, providing a consistent and accessible design system
- **Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming, supporting both light and dark modes
- **File Handling**: Implements drag-and-drop file upload using react-dropzone for intuitive PDF file selection
- **Interactive Features**: Integrates @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop functionality in page reordering operations

## Backend Architecture

The backend follows a minimal Express.js architecture optimized for PDF processing:

- **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **Development Setup**: Uses Vite in development mode with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for rapid development
- **Storage Layer**: Implements an abstraction layer with in-memory storage for user data, designed to be easily replaceable with database solutions
- **API Design**: RESTful API structure with centralized route registration and error handling middleware

## PDF Processing Strategy

The application employs a client-side PDF processing approach:

- **Processing Library**: Designed to use pdf-lib for client-side PDF manipulation, reducing server load and improving privacy
- **File Security**: PDF files are processed entirely in the browser, ensuring user documents never leave their device
- **Mock Implementation**: Currently includes simulated PDF operations for demonstration purposes, ready for real pdf-lib integration

## Database Design

Uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for structured data management:

- **Schema Definition**: Centralized schema definitions in the shared directory for type safety across frontend and backend
- **Migration System**: Configured with Drizzle Kit for database schema migrations
- **User Management**: User profiles linked to Firebase authentication with usage tracking
- **Tool Usage Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of all PDF tool usage with timestamps and metadata
- **File Management**: Temporary file storage with 1-hour automatic expiration for privacy
- **Logging**: PDF processing logs table for tracking user activities and debugging

## Development Workflow

- **Build System**: Vite for frontend bundling with esbuild for backend compilation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking
- **Path Resolution**: Configured path aliases for clean import statements (@/, @shared/)
- **Development Tools**: Integrated with Replit development environment with cartographer plugin for enhanced debugging

## Theme and Styling System

- **Design System**: Implements a comprehensive design token system with CSS custom properties
- **Color Palette**: Custom PDFo brand colors (blue, emerald, violet) integrated throughout the interface
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind CSS breakpoints
- **Font System**: Uses Inter font family with fallbacks for optimal readability
